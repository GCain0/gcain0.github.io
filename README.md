# Project 02: Your Professional Project Repository
This project marks an important step in transforming a simple local webpage into a polished, professional web presence. By creating a GitHub repository, youâ€™ll introduce version control to your workflow, allowing for better organization, collaboration, and long-term maintenance. Publishing your personal website to a live public URL makes your work accessible to others, showcasing your skills and personality in a real-world context. Documenting the process with a well-written README.md file adds clarity and professionalism, helping others understand the purpose, structure, and deployment of your site.

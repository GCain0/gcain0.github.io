# Project 02: Your Professional Project Repository
This project marks an important step in transforming a simple local webpage into a polished, professional web presence. By creating a GitHub repository, I will introduce version control to my workflow, allowing for better organization, collaboration, and long-term maintenance. Publishing my personal website to a live public URL makes my work accessible to others, showcasing my skills and personality in a real-world context. Documenting the process with a well-written README.md file adds clarity and professionalism, helping others understand the purpose, structure, and deployment of my site.

I took my local website and turned it into a professional, version-controlled project. I created a public GitHub repository named after my username and used GitHub Pages to publish my site to a live URL. This was a big step for me because I moved beyond just working with local files, I learned how to use GitHub Desktop, make commits to track my progress, and push changes that actually update my live site. My repository now includes all the key files: index.html, style.css, and a README.md that explains what the site is about. This project helped me understand the full development cycle, from building something on my computer to sharing it with the world.
